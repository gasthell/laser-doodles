Game Overview:
Laser Doodles is a competitive multiplayer game where players use creativity and strategy to draw laser patterns that interact with the environment and opponents. The goal is to outmaneuver and outsmart others by using your drawn lasers to trap, deflect, or eliminate enemies while avoiding their lasers.

Core Gameplay:

Player Setup
Each player controls a small character on a grid-based arena.
Players are equipped with a laser gun that shoots laser beams based on the patterns they draw.

Drawing Mechanics
Players draw their laser paths on the map in real-time, creating strategic lines, shapes, or barriers.

Laser Behaviors
Lasers can reflect off walls or objects.
They can be bent or split using power-ups, creating more complex patterns.
Players can use lasers for offense (directly aiming at opponents) or defense (blocking attacks, creating barriers).
Movement and Evasion
Players move around the arena to avoid enemy lasers while positioning themselves to draw effectively.
Power-ups and environmental hazards force players to stay dynamic.

Game Mode
Every player for themselves. The last player standing wins.

Power-Ups and Abilities
Mirror Shields: Reflect incoming lasers back toward the opponent.
Laser Splitter: Splits one laser into three beams for wider coverage.
Speed Boost: Increases player movement speed to escape tight situations.
Laser Freeze: Temporarily freezes all lasers in place, creating static barriers.

Shockwave Pulse: Emits a circular laser blast that clears enemy lasers nearby.

Arena Design
Dynamic Obstacles
Moving platforms, rotating mirrors, and destructible walls to add complexity.

Interactive Objects
Mirrors that reflect lasers, teleporters that transport lasers, and switches to unlock new areas.
Some levels could feature shrinking arenas, forcing players into tighter spaces.

Themes
Futuristic City: Lasers bounce off skyscrapers and windows.
Space Arena: Low-gravity physics influence laser trajectories.
